# RevisedPredictiveModeling
end-to-end coverage of the book Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn &amp; Kjell Johnson. codes revised and altered by using modern libraries (e.g dplyr instead of plyr, tidyr instead of reshape2, etc.) extra graphics are added for demonstration and interpretability enhancement. new code chunks are presented for further clarity.
